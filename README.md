# BitLocker-Key-Existence-Checker-for-Microsoft-Entra-ID
A PowerShell script that provides compliance-safe visibility into BitLocker recovery key escrow status in Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD).
This script helps organizations audit and verify that BitLocker recovery keys are properly escrowed to Microsoft Entra ID without exposing sensitive cryptographic information. It answers the critical question: "Which devices have BitLocker keys safely stored in the cloud?"

üîí Compliance & Security

‚úÖ Fully Compliant Design

READ-ONLY operations - Never modifies or regenerates keys
No sensitive data exposure - Never retrieves actual recovery keys or key IDs
Metadata only - Shows existence confirmation, creation dates, and device info
Audit-friendly - Creates appropriate audit trail without security risks

üõ°Ô∏è What is NOT Retrieved

‚ùå Actual BitLocker recovery keys

‚ùå BitLocker Key IDs or identifiers

‚ùå Any cryptographic material

‚ùå Sensitive security information

‚úÖ What IS Retrieved

‚úÖ Key existence confirmation ("Yes" vs "No")

‚úÖ Device names and basic information

‚úÖ Key creation timestamps

‚úÖ Volume types (OS drive vs Data drive)

‚úÖ Device trust relationships

üìä Sample Output

Console Summary

BITLOCKER KEY SUMMARY

Total keys found: 1177

Unique devices: 856

Volume Types:

üîç Understanding Results

Volume Types Explained

Type 1: Operating System drives (C: drive with Windows)

Type 2: Fixed data drives (additional internal drives)

Type 3: Removable drives (rare in reports)


Multiple Keys Per Device

Having multiple BitLocker keys for the same device is normal and indicates:

‚úÖ Key rotation for security compliance

‚úÖ Policy-driven key regeneration

‚úÖ System updates triggering new keys

‚úÖ Proper security hygiene


Device Matching Success

Direct DeviceId: Standard successful match

Entra ID Object Id: Alternative successful match method

No Match: Keys from deleted devices or permission issues


‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Safe Operation

This script NEVER damages or regenerates BitLocker keys
Read-only operations ensure zero impact on production systems
Equivalent to viewing file properties without opening files

Performance Considerations

Large environments (1000+ devices) may take 10-15 minutes
Progress indicators show real-time status
Consider running during maintenance windows for very large deployments

Troubleshooting

No keys found: Verify permissions and BitLocker policy configuration
Many "Unknown" devices: Check Device.Read.All permission
Authentication errors: Verify app registration and client secret
